# Sorting-Assignment-5-
A driver class(sort), and three different sorting classes
The driver class (sort) compares three different sorting algorithms on randomly generated arrays of the same size. The three algorithms are: insertionsort, quicksort, an mergesort. The sorting algorithms are tested on arrays of 2048, 4096, 8192, and 16384 integers. The user is asked how many trials they would like to run, and the program then runs that many trials on each array and averages the number of comparisons made by the sort. The comparisons are then output to the console.
